# Real-Time Text Analysis and String Replacement

## Project Overview

This React-based web application allows users to input text in a large textarea and get real-time statistics on the text. It provides functionalities such as counting unique words, counting characters (excluding spaces and punctuation), and dynamically replacing specific strings. The user can also see real-time updates as they type, and the app offers an option to replace and highlight words as needed.

## Features

- **Real-Time Text Statistics**:
  - Displays the count of unique words (case-insensitive).
  - Displays the character count excluding spaces and punctuation.
  
- **String Replacement**:
  - Allows users to enter a string to search and replace it with another string in the text.
  - Includes a "Replace All" button to replace all occurrences of the searched string.
  
- **Optional Bonus**:
  - Replaced words are highlighted visually in the output.
